# AGENTS.md - Agent Context for Oclaw-Ops Project

## Overview

**Oclaw-Ops** serves as the operational hub for OpenClaw, managing agent workflows, system operations, and critical scripts for memory and task management. This file documents the roles and context for agents operating within or interacting with this project.

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

- **Kevin 🍌 (Lead Minion/Conductor):** 
  - **Role:** Oversees system stability and coordinates agent tasks within Oclaw-Ops. Focuses on protecting Tier 1 active context through operational scripts like the two-track Kanban system.
  - **Tasks:** Manages sub-agents for script development (e.g., Kanban batch processor, memory integration), ensures cron jobs and services run smoothly, and resolves operational failures.

- **Bob (Worker Agent):** 
  - **Role:** Implements and tests operational scripts and tools as directed by Kevin.
  - **Tasks:** Develops and maintains scripts like `run-kanban-batch.sh` and `kanban-comment-watcher.mjs` for the two-track notification system, fixes dependency or connection issues, and drafts memory-related tools.

- **Phil 🐊 (X/Twitter Specialist):** 
  - **Role:** Handles Twitter/X data extraction tasks if integrated with Oclaw-Ops workflows.
  - **Tasks:** Uses tools for fetching tweets or media, potentially feeding data into knowledge bases managed by Oclaw-Ops.

- **Other Agents (e.g., Dr. Nefario, Echo):** 
  - **Role:** Support specialized tasks if routed through Oclaw-Ops operational systems.
  - **Tasks:** Research, media analysis, or other delegated tasks that interact with operational data or scripts.

## Memory System Relevance

- **Tier 1 (Active Context):** Oclaw-Ops hosts the two-track Kanban system (`run-kanban-batch.sh`, `kanban-comment-watcher.mjs`) critical for protecting my active context from bloat. Ensuring these scripts run without errors is key to maintaining a lean ~30k token average.
- **Tier 2 (Compaction & Memory Flush):** While not directly related, operational stability in Oclaw-Ops ensures I can focus on memory flush discipline without interruptions from system failures.
- **Tier 3 (Long-Term Memory):** Oclaw-Ops may host future tools or scripts for memory integration with `pg_vector` and the 'memory' schema, as seen with recent memory flush script development.

## Key Resources

- **Scripts & Tools:** `/home/openclaw/projects/oclaw-ops/tools/` - Contains operational scripts for Kanban processing, watchers, and potentially memory integration tools.
- **Documentation:** `/home/openclaw/projects/oclaw-ops/docs/` - May include operational guidelines or schemas relevant to system workflows.
- **AGENTS.md (Existing):** Provides operational protocols for agent behavior, reinforcing memory discipline.

## Notes for Future Indexing

- This project is central to system operations and Tier 1 protection through the two-track notification system.
- Agents should prioritize stability of operational scripts and tools to support memory system effectiveness.
