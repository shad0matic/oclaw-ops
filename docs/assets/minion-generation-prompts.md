## Post-Generation Workflow

1. **Generate** initial 4 variations
2. **Select** best candidate
3. **Apply 2 strong variations** (V button → Strong)
4. **Pick** final version, upscale if needed
5. **Remove background** (white BG is easy — use remove.bg or Figma)
6. **Resize** to 80×80px source (displays at 40px with 2x clarity)
7. **Export** as WebP with transparency
8. **Save** to `dashboard/public/assets/isometric/characters/minions/[agent]_idle.webp`

## Tips

- **Consistency:** Use `--sref [URL]` with Kevin's final image to maintain style
- **Variations:** Strong variations (2x) give best refinement
- **No hat issues:** If unwanted hat appears, edit out in post (faster than fighting MJ)
- **Batch:** Do all idle poses first to maintain style consistency

---

## ❌ What NOT to use

- `pixel art style` — causes grainy/chunky output
- `--no 3d render shadow depth` — confuses the model
- `soft lighting` — makes it too 3D
- Strict pixel dimensions in prompt — MJ ignores them
